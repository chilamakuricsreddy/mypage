I am a Senior Computational Biologist at University of Cambridge with several years of research and teaching experience, holding a PhD in Bioinformatics. My work has focused on applying computational approaches to solve complex biological problems, and I have a strong foundation in biology, chemistry, statistics, and computing. In addition to my research, I’ve enjoyed teaching students at various levels, and I’m passionate about making science accessible and engaging for learners of all backgrounds.
